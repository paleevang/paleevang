### Hi there 👋
### 💮 About Me :
  My name is Palee (Pa-lee). It's an unusual name, but in my native language my name means "Moon Flower". I am currently a student and chose to become a Full-Stack Web Developer because I enjoy the process of creating something from the ground up and love the creativity in this process. Fortunately, coding offers me this! After graduating I want to work and get more experience in this field of work.
- 👩‍🎓: Arizona State University: Graphic Information Technology - Full Stack Web development

- 🥅: Future career goal: Blog + Animal Sanctuary

- 📚: In my free time, I enjoy reading and learning new things!

- 🎥: Favorite movie series: The Hobbit. I enjoy a great adventurous and fantasy storyline.
